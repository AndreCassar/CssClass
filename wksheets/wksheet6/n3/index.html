    <p id="unravel">Tell me, please tell me, what this plot is all about.. Exactly, who resides within me? 
I'm broken, so broken - amidst this world. Yet you laugh, blind to everything.

Being as broken as I am, I hold my breath, 
And it can't be unraveled, it can no longer be unraveled.. Not even the truth. (Freeze) 
Breakable; unbreakable - psychotic; unable to go insane 
I'll find you, and..!

In this shaken, twisted world, I gradually become transparent, unable to be seen. 
Please don't bother looking for me; don't stare at me.. 
I merely don't want to hurt you, inside a world, that came out of someone's imagination. 
So please remember me; as vivid as I was.</p><br/>
